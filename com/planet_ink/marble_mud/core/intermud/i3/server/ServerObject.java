 * An interface for mudlib object's to implement
 */



/**
 * The ServerObject interface prescribes methods which
 * must be defined in any object in the mudlib.
 * Specifically, it wants objects to flag when they
 * are destructed so that the server will stop keeping
 * track of them, and also so that other objects in
 * the mudlib can stop keeping track of them.  It is
 * important to remember with Java that destructing an
 * object does not get rid of all references to it.  You
 * need to get rid of all references to it in order to
 * delete it from memory.  A good mudlib thus will always
 * check if an object is destructed before using it in
 * code and it will remove references to destructed objects.
 * For example:
 * <PRE>
 * MudObject some_object;
 *
 * public void doSomething() {
 *   if( some_object.getDestructed() ) {
 *     some_object = null;
 *     return;
 *   }
 *   some_object.getSomethingDoneTo();
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * For people used to LPC, the above code would be roughly
 * the same as doing:
 * <PRE>
 * object some_object;
 *
 * void do_something() {
 *   if( !some_object ) {
 *     return;
 *   }
 *   some_object->get_something_done_to();
 * }
 * </PRE>
