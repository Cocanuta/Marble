# lists.ini contains miscellaneous charts and string tables that can be user modified.
#
# ** Any string entries can have random options added simply by separating the choices with a 
#    pipe (|) symbol.  For example, the following entry is on the health descriptions:
#
#     ^r<MOB>^r is hovering on deaths door!^N, \
#
#    You can change this to:
#
#     ^r<MOB>^r is hovering on deaths door!^N | ^r<MOB>^r is almost dead!^N  | ^r<MOB>^r is nearly gone!^N  , \
#
#    This change will create 3 random string options where before there was only one.
