ENSLAVE=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : ENSLAVE [TARGET NAME]\n\r\
Example  : enslave orc\n\r\
This skill allows the player to break down an intelligent mob and enslave them. \
Once enslaved, a mob can be sold to slave traders, brought to the players \
clan homes or personal homes to remain as permanent residents, ORDERed as \
vassals of the owner, and, of course, command them to perform tasks.  Tasks \
for the slave to perform must be directed to the slave with the SAY command, \
and must begin with the words "I command you to" or "I order you to".  The \
slave will then wander around as in a GEAS trying to perform the task.  The \
slave can be released from the task by saying "cancel" to them.  Slaves are \
different from pets in that they require food and drink to survive.  If given \
the food and water, they will eat and drink as necessary from what they have \
been given.  Slaves eventually lose loyalty as well.  If they starve, or if \
they take damage for any reason, their loyalty will decrease, making them \
more and more likely to leave their masters homes, or attack their masters.

for the slave to perform must be directed to the slave with the SAY command, \
and must begin with the words "I command you to" or "I order you to".  The \
slave will then wander around as in a GEAS trying to perform the task.  The \

for the skill to work.  They must also be bound or prone.

FRAGMENTATION=<ABILITY>\

Example : flee\n\r\
While in combat, your character may need to quickly disengage and flee \
the room.  A direction may be specified, but if one is not specified, \
a direction will be chosen for you.  Fleeing from combat can cause \
you to lose experience points in many cases, so use this command \

Usage    : FRAME\n\r\
Example  : frame\n\r\

Usage    : HANDCUFF [TARGET NAME] \n\r\
Example  : cuff orc\n\r\
Allows the player to bind another mob that is sitting or lying down, and force them \

ability to resist certain demeaning blows (such as  Coup De \
Graces, kicks, whomps, bashes, dirt kicks, trips, etc..) \
grows.


HIDE=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : HIDE \n\r\
Example  : hide\n\r\
The thief attempts to creep into some shadowy corner \
and remain perfectly still.  Doing this makes them invisible \
to any other creatures in the room.  Making any moves or sounds \
will negate the hidden advantage.  \
The quality of the hide against other players depends in part on \
the thieves stealth expertise. \
The thief can use the VISIBLE command to make themself visible again.  

HIDE_IN_PLAIN_SIGHT=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : HIDEINPLAINSIGHT\n\r\
Example  : hips\n\r\

do almost anything without being directly noticed.  Almost any quiet \
movement, such as getting or dropping items, wearing or removing items, \
or manipulating inventory, \

will be done so that people aren't really sure who did it.  Direct speaking \
or giving is unaffected, however.

HIDE_OTHER=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : OTHERHIDE [TARGET] \n\r\
Example  : otherhide bob\n\r\
The thief attempts to hide a group member in some shadowy corner \
and directs them to remain perfectly still.  Doing this makes the target invisible \
to any other creatures in the room.  If the target makes any moves or sounds, it \
will negate the hidden advantage.  \
The quality of the hide will depend in part on the thieves stealth expertise. \
The VISIBLE command can be used to revoke this affect.

MARKER_SPYING=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : MARKER SPYING [TARGET] \n\r\

themselves read, regardless of where they are in the world. \n\r\
\n\r\
This skill is identical to SPYING, but does not require that \
the thief and the one spyed on be in the same room, and it \
only works on those the thief has MARKed.  The skill \
automatically transfers from Mark to Mark indefinitely, or \
until disengaged.

SPYING=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : SPYING [TARGET] \n\r\
Example  : spy bob\n\r\

lasts indefinitely once the thief has figured out how to spy on the target. \
The level of player the thief can spy on depends on part on stealth expertise.

EVESDROP=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : EVESDROP [TARGET] \n\r\
Example  : evesdrop bob\n\r\
The thief atunes his hearing so well that he can hear TELL messages to the \
target, so long as he remains in the same room as the target and remains \
unnoticed by the target.  The level of the player the thief can evesdrop on, \
and the duration of the evesdropping will depend on alertness expertise.

ESPIONAGE=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : ESPIONAGE [TARGET] \n\r\
Example  : espionage bob\n\r\
The thief uses the target to spy on the targets clan communications.  Any \
talk on the targets clan-only or clan-ally channels will also be heard by the thief, \
so long as the thief is in the same room, and remains unnoticed by the target. \
The level of the player that can be used by the thief for espionage will depend on \
the thiefs level and on stealth expertise.

is in the room, due to their extreme ability to go unnoticed when \
their energy is focused (as when the mark is present).  See the \
MARK ability for more information.

INTIMIDATION=FIGHTER_INTIMIDATE
FIGHTER_INTIMIDATE=<ABILITY>\
Example  : \n\r\

chants learned through Spellcraft, Prayercraft, etc to be faked \

(no damage or benefits from casting), but will enable the character \
to deceive others into believing that he can use that type of magic.

Example  : juggle all\n\r\
Example  : juggle dagger\n\r\
Example  : juggle\n\r\
This will cause the player to begin juggling one or more items.  The \
number of items the player may juggle is limited by level.  Entering \
juggle without an item name will stop juggling.  GETting an item \

strategic hits on the target.  The actual damage will be minimal, \

cold instead of killing them.  Dueing combat, a smart fighter can \
examine his or her target and tell how close they are to being \
fully subdued despite the apparant actual damage done.  Once knocked \

Usage    : BOMB [ITEM] [BOMB NAME]\n\r\
Example  : bomb list\n\r\

to drop, throw, or do whatever they need to before the \

or her magical plants still alive, and where they are.\n\r\
\n\r\
This skill is most useful for Plant Pass and for creating a druidic connection \
to an area.  A druid in a rural area has placed one of his or her plants in \
at least 50% of the rooms in an area will create a druidic connection to the area. \
See also Druidic Connection for more information on this phenomenon.\n\r\
\n\r\

in this way.

up the longer the player has to "observe" the mark.  The mark is observed \
whenever the player is in the same room as the mark and can see him, but \

certain higher level assassin skills.  You can issue a Mark a second time \
against the same target to remove the mark.
