Usage    : WEAPONSMITH (LIST/MEND/SCAN/LEARN) [WEAPON TYPE]\n\r\
Example  : weaponsmith twohanded sword\n\r\
         : weaponsmith list\n\r\
         : weaponsmith list sword\n\r\

         : weaponsmith learn knife\n\r\
This skill allows a player to craft weapons from metal.  This \
skill requires Blacksmithing in order to learn it.  It also requires \
specialization in the weapon type the player wishes to make.  The extent of \
the weapons which can be crafted expands as the player goes up in \
level.  To begin smithing, the player must be in a room with an \
open fire burning, and must have placed the metal he or she wishes \
to make the weapon from on the ground.  The player may also scan the \
room or other players for equipment that may be mended by this skill, \
using the scan parameter, or learn to how to smith a found item, provided \
a blank recipe page, or recipe book with blank pages is in his or her inventory. \
The metal for weaponsmithing is obtained using the Mining skill, or \
better metals from the Smelting skill. Using better materials will \
increase both the strength and the required level of the crafted item.
