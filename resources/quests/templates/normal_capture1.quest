#!QUESTMAKER_PAGE Specify the Announcer
#The Announcer is the mob who will be wanting the other mobs captured. This must
#be an existing mob in your world.  
#
#Announcer Area/Room: 
#Specify below the name of the area that your announcer mob will be located
#in and/or the room in which the mob can be found.  You may leave both blank
#to force the quest manager to find the mob somewhere in the world, but this
#will hurt the performance of your mud, so use with care.
#Use double-quotes around multi-word areas and room ids/names.
#  
#Announcer Area:
#$ANNOUNCER_AREA=($AREA)
#Announcer Room ID:

#Specify the name of the mob who will act as the announcer mob.

#If you specified an area or room above, then the mob must be located there.
#You may optionally have the quest manager select a 'random' mob by entering
#a mob name of ANY MASK= followed by a Zapper Mask (see help on 
#ZAPPERMASKS for information on zapper mask syntax).
#Remember, if the quest manager can not find your mob, the quest will not
#be started.

#
#!QUESTMAKER_PAGE Announcer speaches
#Specify here some optional things to say for the announcer before and after the quest.

#

#Specify some additional bit of speech the announcer mob will say to players when the quest is accepted.
#$QUEST_INSTRUCTIONSSTRING=($LONG_STRING)=I need you to capture some folks.  They are somewhere around somewhere.  You might have to get rough with them.
#
#Announcer success:
#This is what the announcement says when the player returns with all the capturable mobs.
#$QUEST_WINSPEECH_TEXT=($LONG_STRING)=Congratulations! You got them!
#
#!QUESTMAKER_PAGE Specify the Captureable Mob or Mobs
#The Capturables are the mob or mobs which must be defeated.
#
#Captureable mobs: 
#Specify below the mobs that the player must capture to get credit for this quest.

#
#Capturables response: 
#You may optionally specify some additional bit of speech the capturables

#
#!QUESTMAKER_PAGE Capturables Behavior

#them, and VIOLENT if the capturable mobs must be defeated in combat first.
#$CAPTURABLES_FOLLOW=$CHOOSE=VIOLENT,PEACEFUL
#
#Capturables attack:
#Will the mobs attack if they spot the player?  Keep in mind this is above and
#beyond any aggressive behaviors they may have, and will neither modify or 
#supress their natural aggressive behaviors.  Obviously attacking makes no
#sense if they surrender peacefully, but requiring a violent capture doesn't
#necessarily mean the mobs start the fight either.
#$CAPTURABLES_ATTACK=$CHOOSE=NO-USE-DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR,YES-ATTACK-ON-SIGHT
#
#Capturables surrender: 
#You may optionally specify some additional bit of speech the capturables
