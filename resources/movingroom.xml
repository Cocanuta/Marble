<MOVINGDATA>
  <INSTRUCTIONS>
	<One> First off you -must- make the xml document -before- setting Moving behaviour on the room.</One>
	<Two> Second the rooms in the STOPS section -must- exist -before- you make the XML document.</Two>
	<Three> The moving behaviour parameters are as such:
		min=3 max=3 chance=100;[XML section];[time at stops];[time between stops]
	   [XML section] is the group the class will parse, in the second example its SUBWAY
	   [time at stops] is the ticks the room waits at each stop (ie. 4 sec per tick)</Three>
	<Four> Look at the Examples below to see what to fill in each field. <NOTE/> it might be easier to view the examples in a XML viewer such as Internet Explorer.</Four>

	   <A/>$disproom	-when the door is opened: (room is stopped)
			 	this is the room name the door leads to.
				-when the door is closed: (room is moving to next stop)
			 	this is the room that is the next stop.
	   <B/>$inopendir   -this is the direction the door opens from the inside.
	   <C/>$outopendir  -this is the direction the door opens from the outside.
