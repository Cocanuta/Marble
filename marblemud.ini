# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new resource to create, or "REPLACEMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old res.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the resource (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a material (CLOTH, LEATHER, METAL,MITHRIL, WOODEN, GLASS, VEGETATION, 
#    FLESH, PAPER, ROCK, LIQUID, PRECIOUS, ENERGY, PLASTIC), 
# 2. a smell (if any), 
# 3. value, 
# 4. rarity weight (1-100, lower=rarer), 
# 5. hardness (0-6), 
# 6. bouancy (0-30000), 
# 7. the gathering category (FISH, BERRY, or nothing).
# 8. an optional ability ID (currently only for eating the raw form)
# For example:
# ADDMATERIAL_FLUFF=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# REPLACEMATERIAL_COTTON=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# ADDMATERIAL_GRUG=flesh,strong meaty,3,15,1,2000,FISH,

# ADDWEARLOC and REPLACEWEARLOC allow you to add or modify the wearable  
# locations used by the Marblemud engine for mobs.  These are things like 
# left finger, on eyes, on torso, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate places, and their values will available to the archons.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new location to create, or "REPLACEWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old loc.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the location (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a list of wear locations dependent on this one sep. by | characters, 
# 2. the armor score of this location (0.0 - 2.0), 
# 3. the displayed order (0-n), 
# 4. the weight score for cloth (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 5. for leather (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 6. for metal (0.0 - 10.0).  
# For example:
# ADDWEARLOC_FACE=eyes|mouth,0.2,16,0.5,0.7,1.0
# REPLACEWEARLOC_EYES=,0.1,7,0.1,0.2,0.3
